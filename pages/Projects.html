  <p class="one">These were just a few projects that I'm proud of so far and remade during class. Our job was to try to recreate a portion of a website.</p>
  <p class="two">In this project, we had to recreate a portion of the Amazon website. So we had eight items to work with and have separate links for, followed by some headings.</p>
  <p class="three">In this project, we had to recreate the About page for Instagram. I mainly focused on getting the overall setup of the page rather than the links just to see if I was capable of doing so.</p>
